    <h2>Guitars</h2>

    <p>
        Dimebag was famous for his use of Dean ML guitars like his heavily modified <i>Dean From Hell</i> one seen here. Dimebag originally won this guitar after winning a shredding competition, that he sold to purchase a yellow Pontiac Firebird. This same guitar started life as a maroon color, was modified with its classic lightning bolt design by another owner, and Dimebag eventually purchased back his original guitar that he had won.
